# sensors-calib-inertial
Application for calibrating multiple sensor modalities using inertial measurements. It calibrates: the accelerometers offsets, axis gains and cross-axis sensivities; the joint encoders offsets.
Later on, additional sensors will be added to the list, like gyroscopes and FT sensors. We can also integrate in the framework additional identification procedures, like for instance the joint friction parameters estimation.
